# Fraud Detection in Transactions using CatBoost
This repository contains the code and documentation corresponding to the team TensileTensors' submission to the Inter-IIT Convolve competition.

## About
The objective of the hackathon was to identify anomalies (fraudsters) from a collection of transaction history data of different consumer bank customers. Each row corresponded to a bank account with columns describing the details regarding the account such as the list of all transactions, demography, etc.

We finally achieved an accuracy 99.535% and an F1 score of 0.886 in identifying fraudsters using CatBoost after experimenting with several models such as RandomForests, SVM, Bagging, and XGBoost.
